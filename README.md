This repository is for Eaux Sauvages' personal website.
It has a homepage, a random thoughts page, a themed thinking page, and a profile page.
The homepage is designed with fonts and background images that change when you refresh.
Some short inspirational sentences are recorded on the Unfocused thoughts page. Content about a topic that can be discussed in a focused manner is collected on the Paragraphes avec thèmes page. Umschlag is a letter to my friend Arthur. Portfolio outlines the project to which the website belongs, and others.
Note ※ The language of the website is confusing, which is necessary, please don't worry about it being your problem. Of course, this is not my problem, it is intentional. ※
